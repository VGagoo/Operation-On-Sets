# Operation-On-Sets
This project is a web-based application that performs various operations on sets. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for performing operations such as union, intersection, and difference on sets.
# The four basic operations on sets are :
 1.Union of sets
 2.Intersection of sets
 3.Set Diference
 4.Complement of set
 In this tutorial we will be using Venn Diagrams to demonstrate the operations on sets
# Venn Diagram
A Venn diagram is an illustration that uses circles 
to show the relationships among things or fnite 
groups of things. Circles that overlap have a 
commonality while circles that do not overlap do 
not share those traits
